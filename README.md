# TouchpadTest
Simple test project used to explore how to read raw data from the touch input devices like screen and touchpad.
each touch point will be shown on the screen using a graphic.

The project contains code from many sources including VS samples and docs. 
The HID handling code was ported from this sample in dotnet: https://github.com/emoacht/RawInput.Touchpad

The sample is not complete or tested and intended only to show code patterns and approaches.
